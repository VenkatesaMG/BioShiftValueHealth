# 🗣️Voice-Activated System For Electronic Health Record (EHR) Documentation 📋🩺

## 📌 Overview
A voice-activated system designed to monitor patient-physician interactions and convert voice data into raw text, which is then processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate structured clinical reports. This solution reduces the time physicians spend on documentation, allowing them to focus more on patient care, thereby improving the throughput and efficiency of healthcare facilities.
